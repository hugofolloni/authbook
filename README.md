# authbook

## 🗒️ About this project
A notebook with authentication. My first project with accounts and different results for different users. This project is simply a place where you can store all your thoughts and ideas.

## 🧔 User Story
On the first page, the user can see the login form. If the user exists, he can login and see his notes. If the user does not exist, he can create an account. To login, the server searches on the database and check if the user exists and the password is correct. The user can create, edit and delete notes, and the server stores the data in the database. Of course, each user will see only his data, and it was very challenging for me to create this, because it was my first time working with this.
